# 🎧 Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC)

Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is a machine learning–based system that classifies environmental sounds such as rain, traffic, animals, and machinery.  
The project provides a simple web interface where users can upload an audio file and receive predictions along with visual analysis.

This system demonstrates the complete pipeline of audio preprocessing, feature extraction, model inference, and result visualization using modern web and ML technologies.
